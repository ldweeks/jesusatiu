Questions to consider:

If you had the power to “fix” this world, what would you do? What did Jesus do?
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
Gathered disciples
Healed every kind of disease and sickness
What does it mean to be “blessed”?
To be happy, content, joyful, peaceful
To be “blessed” depends on God blessing you.
We live in relation to God. Ultimate satisfaction is in Him. Everything else is a forgery.
This only makes sense in light of eternity. There is something after this life.
One way to help understand the meaning of death is that it is an end to sin. Hitler is gone.
What are the alternative ways of thinking about or describing “blessedness”?
you make it up yourself, 
personal happiness, 
pleasure, 
to live forever, 
recognition
wealth and prosperity
Virtue,
Nobility
Honor, a good name
Recognition
There is no such thing
What are you aiming at in life?
Don’t need to answer out load, but you are a fool if you don’t think about this very carefully.
What does it mean to be “poor in spirit”? What does it not mean?
It does not mean that
We don’t have money
We have a shrunken, stingy attitude toward God and others (opposite of nobility of heart and soul)

We have to deny distinctions between people (some people become president, others work at fast food restaurants). There are 
We are cowardly or faithless. We do not accuse God of being a harsh task master.
It does mean that we know our own sin and our complete dependence upon the grace and mercy of God. It does mean that we know each and every day is a gift from God.
It is the doorway to all the other graces. It is the foundation for being a disciple of Jesus Christ. We cannot have anything else that Jesus talks about unless we have this:
Grace
Jesus
Heaven
What is the “Kingdom of Heaven”? Is it a place? Is it a metaphor? Is it simply an idea?
The kingdom of heaven is where God is.
It is where we can find perfect peace, perfect joy, perfect happiness.
It is perfectly secure. It will last eternally.
It will not shift or change.
It is where we are known by God and loved by Him. If you had a good dad, it is the part where dad welcomes us onto his lap when we are a little child and he strokes our back and comforts us. We are home, safe and sound forevermore.
What “kingdom” are we in right now?
The kingdom of God is at hand! You can touch it!
The kingdom of God is within you!
And yet, we see as through a glass dimly.
