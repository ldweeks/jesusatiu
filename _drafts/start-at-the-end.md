Welcome to Indiana University! Whether you are a freshman this year or a grizzled old senior, I hope you're excited to be back in Bloomington and back at IU. There are many good reasons to attend college, and there are many good reasons to come to Indiana University. But before classes begin, you should ask yourself an important question: why are *you* here?

They say that the time and money necessary to attend college is an investment in your future. You're young and you lack experience and knowledge, but you're full of hope and possibilities. That all sounds good, but what is that future you seek? What's the goal? Where are you headed?

Nearly 90% of the undergraduate students at IU last spring were between 18 and 24 years old. It's very rare for an 18 year old arriving to college as a freshman to be thinking much past the next four years. Many students get caught with the mythological American "college life" of parties and sex and basketball games.

But you must think beyond that. College should not be the high point of your life. Where are you headed after college?

The way to answer that question is to start at the end, and work your way backwards. You want the American dream? Then with the right degree and the right connections, four or five years at IU could be the ticket to a white collar job with four weeks of vacation and a six-digit salary. And then, after putting in 30-40 years of work, you can retire and travel the world.

Is that as far as your thinking goes? If so, you're not thinking far enough ahead. 

When we're young, we have a hard time imaging the distant future. Whether we think about it consciously or not, we *act* as if we will live forever. But if we are wise, we will wake up to the fact that after all the thrills and pleasures and wonders of this life, there is a sick joke at the end of it all. There is a surprise ending.

You, and everyone you know, will die one day. Few people will remember you when you've been dead for fifty years; no one will remember you after one hundred years. And yet, if the Lord tarries, the planet will continue to spin and everyone else will go on with their lives without you.

To make the most of college, you have to think about where you're headed. To make the most of life, you must think carefully about your death.

What is death? 

Is it simply the end, like most of the atheists and naturalists believe? Like a sick punch line at the end of an extended joke?

Is it part of an endless cycle of death and birth, as the Hindus believe? 

The Bible says that death is the punishment for our sin and wickedness, but it is not our final end. Hebrews 9 teaches that it is appointed for men to die once and then to face the judgment before Jesus Christ.

Does anything about your life indicate that you are preparing for that day? Are you living for God? Do you know anything about Him and what He requires of you in this life? IU offers many exciting possibilities, but if you miss this, you've missed everything that matters.

--------------

I should focus this entire post on the hope we have in Jesus Christ. On the love of God through Christ.

Jesus came to save sinners, and God sent His son to draw us near to himself.

THEN, the next two posts should be about long term relationships and the work you will do.
