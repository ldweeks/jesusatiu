Welcome to Indiana University! Whether you are a freshman this year or a grizzled old senior, I hope you're excited to be back in Bloomington and back at IU.

College is a right of passage in our day that is filled with excitement. The world is new and fresh. Many are away from home for the first time, and you have an opportunity to make yourself. Everything is fresh and new and exciting, and you're around other young people who genererally see the world with the same kind of hope and optimism.

So what would I say to you? What advice would I give you?

Start at the end, and work your way backwards. The youth think they are invincible, and that they will go on forever. But there is a joke at the end of this ride. (Stick with me here, it's about to get bumpy...)

You, and everyone you know, will die one day. Few people will remember you when you've been dead for fifty years - no one will remember you after one hundred years. And yet, if the Lord tarries, the planet will continue to spin and everyone else will go on with their life just fine without you.

To make the most of college, you have to think about where you're headed. To make the most of life, you must think carefully about your death.

MORE ABOUT DEATH AS AN ANVIL.

WHAT IS DEATH, ANYWAY? IS IT THE END? A PASSAGE? A RECURRING THING? NO, IT IS:

The Bible says it is appointed for men to die once and then to face the judgment. (Hebrews 9:27) Does anything about your life indicate that you are preparing for that day? Are you living for God? Do you know anything about Him and what He requires of you in this life?

IU offers many exciting possibilities, but if you miss this, you've missed everything that matters.

There are two other important parts to this time in your life: long-term relationships and the kind of work you will do. You are at IU, on paper, because you are interested in a certain field of study and hope to be gainfully employed in that area at some point. But I'm going to begin with the long-term relationships because it is more important.

Christmas carol - scene with scrooge at the end.

Imagein you're funeral. Who would you want to be in attendance? Most likely a loving husband or wife. Your children and grandchildren. daughters and sons-in-law. Friends. How would such a scene be possible? A family is established when a man and a woman say, "I do", and commit to be together through thick and think for the rest of their lives. I know that it might sound naive and idealistic, but that's because we have lost our way. But trust me: much of your happiness in this life depends on finding a good spouse.

You think you have plenty of time to marry, but it's not true! Daylight is burning, boys. Ask her out.

Finally, the "reason" for attending IU in the first place: intellectual growth and gainful employment. The world is filled with wonders, so pick something that makes you sit up and pay attention! If school is boring, you're doing it wrong.

One tip: pick the good professors. That matters more than the particular subject matter.
