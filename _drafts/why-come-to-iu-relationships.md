As I said in an [earlier post](https://jesusatiu.com/blog/2023/08/soul-that-will-never-die), there are countless reasons to move to Bloomington and come to Indiana University. Naturally, many of those reasons have to do with career development of some kind. You are at IU, after all, because you are interested in a certain field of study and hope to be gainfully employed in that field at some point. But in this post, I want to convince you to think about something else entirely. I want to convince you to think about marriage.

I suspect that your freshman orientation did not touch on marriage at all. It's a safe bet that none of your conversations with classmates, administrators or professors in the first couple weeks brought up marriage at any point. Life at Indiana University has no necessary connection to marriage.

That may all sound perfectly normal and reasonable to us, but we have to realize that we are a product of our times. In all of history, I suspect it would be considered very strange for a culture to encourage thousands of young, single men and women to live, work and play together every day, and for all that to happen while marriage is an afterthought. 

But it's much worse than that, particularly if you come from a Christian home. More than that, it is problem even forbidden! More about families forbidding marriage until college is done. Women aren't to think about children until they have established themselves in their career.

This is the insanity of our times. We are upside down and inside out when it comes to men and women. 

No, historically, young men and women are thinking about marriage. They are concerned about it. Their families are concerned about it. And maybe you can give me examples of cultures where that's not the case. Perhaps, but I doubt it. And I deny it when it comes to *Christian* cultures.

The main curriculum at Indiana University, the institution which gave Alfred Kinsey his platform, is sex. He famously said that the only unnatural sex act is one which you cannot perform. That statement won't be found in the syllabus for any class at IU, but I believe it expresses the ethos of the institution.

So how do you prepare for something as quaint as marriage at a place like Indiana University?

For starters, be pure. There is no such thing as "free love" or "free sex". Serial relationships are not only a hazard to your health, they are a cancer to your soul. Don't look at pornography. Prepare your heart and mind to be with one woman or one man for the rest of your life.

Come to church. Surround yourself with others who know they are sick and need to be made well by the great physician. Find a young man who is serious and willing to work his tail off for you. Find a young woman who is willing to be your help mate.

Learn what it means to embrace the beautiful, God-given distinctions between male and female. Don't oppose them, roll your eyes at them or dismiss them. Instead, study them. Delight in them.

Finally, think about family. Think about the joy of welcoming a little baby into your home one day. The time to have children is when you're young. The world may tell you that you should focus on This is the perfect time in your life to think ab

if thousands of young men and women What a strange thing for thousands of young men and women to be thrown together and to think nothing about marriage.

Christmas carol - scene with scrooge at the end.

Imagein you're funeral. Who would you want to be in attendance? Most likely a loving husband or wife. Your children and grandchildren. daughters and sons-in-law. Friends. How would such a scene be possible? A family is established when a man and a woman say, "I do", and commit to be together through thick and think for the rest of their lives. I know that it might sound naive and idealistic, but that's because we have lost our way. But trust me: much of your happiness in this life depends on finding a good spouse.

You think you have plenty of time to marry, but it's not true! Daylight is burning, boys. Ask her out.



People tell you that you have all the time in the world. 

No. You don't.

I can imagine that you are angry. Young women filled with fear and anxiety. Young men filled with bitterness. Incels. Red pill.

I pointed out recently that we should all consider the day of our death.

Does that make you anxious? Does that make you bitter? You want to fall in love. You want to find your soul mate. Fine.

Countless young men and women have never had that opportunity. They died too soon. Countless others have been stuck married to a horrible person.

My point is that your response here is like everything else in life. Are you like Thomas Jackson, I'm as safe in my bed as on the battle field?

So what does this mean?

It means that you should be hopeful and serious about finding someone to marry. This world is a big place. There is someone for you.

First of all, what you do to prepare for such a momentous choice is different if you're a man vs. a woman. There is an assumption today that we are all just interchangeable parts. There is an assumption that we can just be whatever we want to be. We believe this down to our very bodies. The transgender stuff teaches that we can carve up our bodies however we want.

But you can't. That pressure you feel to be something you're not good at? That's life. That's existential. That's the way it should be.

We are not spirits, we are bodies. To continue stating the obvious, our bodies give us a clue about our work: a woman is called to 

So, ladies. 

Authority and submission in the marriage relationship is a microcosm of all the rest of it. It is a way of showing the world what authority is supposed to look like.
