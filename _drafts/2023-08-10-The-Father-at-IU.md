Does Indiana University have a “father”?

On January 20, 1820, the infant state of Indiana (admitted into the union in 1816) passed a law to establish a state seminary in Bloomington. One of the trustees commissioned to establish the school was a man named David H. Maxwell. A physician by trade, Dr. Maxwell became a vocal supporter for the founding of a state college in Bloomington after his move to the small town in 1819. That same year the first church in Bloomington was also founded at his personal home. Due to his substantial influence in founding the seminary, Dr. Maxwell has often been called the “father of Indiana University”.

What is a “father”?

This word conjures up all sorts of thoughts and feelings in us. Our first impulse may be to think of the parent-child relationship associated with the term, including our own relationships with our fathers. We may have had an amazing father, who out of love established a household for us to grow up and be educated in. Or maybe we had a horrible father, who rejected his responsibilities and sought to please only himself.

It's hard to describe the latter as a “father”. “Father” is a tender title, conveying affection. A father builds, provides and protects. By leading his wife and children he creates an environment where life can flourish. By doing his work, his wife can do hers and his children can do theirs. Working together they build an institution.

We also know, by experience, fathers who are not our biological ones. These we often call “father figures”. Whether they are our professors, coaches, big brothers, co-workers, or pastors, they are our fathers too. There are good and bad ones.

The Bible tells us that fathers exist because God is a father. In fact, God is _the_ Father from which all fatherhood derives its origin (Ephesians 3:14-15). He is the Father of the universe, creating it out of nothing. He founded the earth and built us out of the dirt to be His children. God is a good Father. If we have a problem with God being the Father, it’s often because we have been bad children. We project our sins and the sins of our fathers onto the true Father because we don’t want to be disciplined, judged and taught by Him. 

Does Indiana University, right now, have a “father”?

You might be wondering what fatherhood has to do with being a student at IU. While you are in Bloomington you will have a multitude of men (and women) trying to father (or un-father) you. Some will be professors or fellow students who actually care about you, your education, and your soul. Others will try to turn you away from God the Father, deconstructing, warping and tearing apart the goodness of fatherhood. Fatherhood, for them, can never be anything other than oppressive. Education, for them, has nothing to do with God.

IU being founded as a seminary doesn’t make it one now.

Who will be your fathers at IU? Will you isolate on campus and refuse church fathers into your life? Will you surround yourself with brother-fathers who mentor you to know Jesus Christ? Will you cling to God the Father so you can be forgiven and taught by Him?

Is the Father allowed to educate you at Indiana University?
