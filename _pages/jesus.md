## Who is Jesus?

The Bible says this about Jesus:

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Though Jesus was killed and buried two thousand years ago, he rose from the dead and lives today. He will return to judge the world:

> Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.

## What does it mean to be "saved"?

To answer that question, we have to start at the beginning. God made us, and so He rules over us. We belong to Him. Unfortunately, we are all born with a desire to live as if God doesn't exist. We want to go our own way and to do whatever pleases us. The Bible calls this rebellion against God "sin".

God is perfectly good, and so He condemns us for our sin. We live under God's judgement *now* as a result of our sin, and without a miraculous rescue, we will be condemned to Hell *eternally* when we die. To "get saved" means to be saved from the wrath of God.

God loves the world He created, and so He sent His own divine Son – the man, Jesus Christ – into the world to save us. Unlike us, Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He didn't rebel against God, but he was tortured and executed on a Roman cross as a *substitute* for us. God accepted Jesus' death as payment for our sins and vindicated him by raising him from the dead. Because Jesus died in our place, we can be forgiven for our sins.

So how do we "get saved"? By turning to God in humility and asking for forgiveness for our rebellion against Him. That's for starters. Then we trust in Jesus as our resurrected ruler and savior. We trust His promise that we are freely and completely forgiven in Him. And then we go on to live the rest of our lives with Jesus as our Lord.
