## Lucas Weeks

![Lucas](../assets/images/lucas.jpeg)

My name is Lucas Weeks, and I'm the college pastor at [Trinity Reformed Church](https://trinityreformed.org). I'm married to Hannah. It's the best. We a houseful of kids, which makes getting out the door for school in the morning quite a challenge.

I graduated from Indiana University with a BA in International Studies and a minor in biology. I had intended to try for medical school, but I fell in love with Christ's bride, the church, and decided to give my life to serving her. I trained to become a pastor at Clearnote Pastors College, now called [New Geneva Academy](https://www.newgenevaacademy.com).

One of my favorite passages from the Bible is in Ephesians 3:

> For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; _and_ that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.

I hope to know the love of Christ more each day.
