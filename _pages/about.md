Trinity Reformed Fellowship exists to reach students on the campus of Indiana University with the love of Jesus. We are a ministry of [Trinity Reformed Church](https://trinityreformed.org), a Reformed Protestant church located on the west side of Bloomington, Indiana. We have lively worship on Sunday mornings and regular lunches for students after church. Please [get in touch](https://trinityreformed.churchcenter.com/people/forms/284770) if you'd like a ride!

The best way to get to know us is to join us for worship on a Sunday morning or for a college group Bible study on Wednesdays during the school year at 7pm at the IMU. We hope you will! Below are answers to some basic questions about who we are and what we believe.

## What does “reformed” mean?

When we use the word "reformed" in our name, we are pointing to where we came from in history, and to what we believe now. 

We want people to know that we identify with the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century and that we still hold to the beliefs which motivated that movement. Many different church leaders all over Europe worked to reform the church at that time, and they wrote down what they believed in a variety of formal documents which are collectively called "confessions".

We consider these churches to be our heritage. Over decades and centuries, churches which descended from the Protestant Reformation continued the practice of writing "confessions". One of those confessions, and the one which our church holds to in particular, is called the [Westminster Confession of Faith](https://evangelpresbytery.com/westminster-confession-of-faith/).

## What is Evangel Presbytery?

Evangel Presbytery is an association of reformed churches which was formed in June, 2019. Trinity Reformed Church is a founding member. To read more about Evangel's commitments, please [click here](https://evangelpresbytery.com/our-commitments/).

## What is a "presbytery"?

The word "presbytery" refers to the way a church is governed. It comes from the Koine Greek word *presbyteros* which means "elder". An example from Scripture can be found in 1 Timothy 5:17:

> The elders (*presbyteros*) who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.

So a presbyterian church is governed by a group of elders within that church. That group of elders includes all the local pastors actively working in that congregation (often referred to as *teaching elders*) and the non-ordained, lay elders.

But unlike *congregational* churches which are not generally answerable to any other church or institution, a church under the presbyterian system of government is answerable to their *presbytery*. A presbytery consists of the pastors and elders of multiple churches who work together for one another's mutual benefit. In our case, our pastors and elders are members of [Evangel Presbytery](https://evangelpresbytery.com).

## How is Evangel Presbytery different from other presbyterian denominations?

Evangel Presbytery strives to be "boringly normal" when compared to historic, American presbyterianism. The main difference between Evangel and most other presbyterian denominations is its commitment to freedom on the question of time and mode of baptism. Over the years, however, more churches and denominations have adopted a similar position, so this has become even less of a distinction.
