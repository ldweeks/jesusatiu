Trinity Reformed Fellowship exists to reach students on the campus of [Indiana University](https://bloomington.iu.edu) with the love of Jesus. We are a ministry of [Trinity Reformed Church](https://trinityreformed.org), a Reformed Protestant church located on the west side of Bloomington, Indiana. We have lively worship on Sunday mornings and regular lunches for students after church. 

Please [get in touch](https://trinityreformed.churchcenter.com/people/forms/284770) if you'd like a ride!

The best way to know what we're about is to join us for worship on Sunday morning or for college group Bible study on campus. We hope you will!

## What does “reformed” mean?

When we use the word "reformed" in our name, we are pointing to where we came from in history, and to who we are today.

The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century was a white hot explosion of faith in God and in His Word, and we want people to know that we hold to the beliefs which motivated that movement. We *(cough)* **identify** with it. The reformers believed that God is strong and good and that man is weak and wicked, and we think that's about right.

The reformers trusted the words of the Bible when it was very unpopular to do so, and they didn't hide their convictions. They wrote down what they believed so that everyone could see what they were willing to live and to die for. We're doing our best to follow their example.
