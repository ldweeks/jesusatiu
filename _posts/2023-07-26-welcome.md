Welcome! My name is Lucas Weeks, and I'm the college pastor at Trinity Reformed Church. We're a Protestant Reformed church located on the west side of Bloomington, Indiana. This website is a ministry of Trinity Reformed Fellowship, our church's outreach to the campus of [Indiana University Bloomington](https://bloomington.iu.edu).

Let's not beat around the bush: if you're planning to be in Bloomington, Indiana anytime soon, we'd love to meet you.
