No one knew anything about Oliver Anthony a week ago, but he has sure made a splash on the internet. His song, *Rich Men North of Richmond* ([lyrics below](#rich-men-north-of-richmond)), was released just seven days ago on Youtube, and it currently has over 15 million views. If anyone was curious, the culture wars are *not* behind us. Take a look:

It's a powerful song that hits you right in the feels. Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* had a similar effect when slavery was still legal in this country. Upton Sinclair did the same for factory workers in the early 1900's with *The Jungle*.

It got me thinking about a conversation I had years ago with a young man about a different song. This man is about twelve years younger than I am, so when he played *[What It's Like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMYz5SteBBY)* [(lyrics)](#what-its-like) by Everlast for me, I was already familiar with it. He was three when it came out - I had listened to it on the radio during my junior year of high school when it was popular. It is a catchy blues/rap crossover championing the cause of the down-and-out. It mentions the homeless and an abandoned young woman who gets an abortion.

Everlast (Erik Schrody) is a white dude who attended Taft High School in Los Angeles at the same time that Ice Cube and at least one member of the rap group N.W.A attended. Oliver Anthony's Wikipedia page, which has only existed for three days, reports that Oliver Anthony is from Farmville, Virginia, population 7,473.

These two songs are a mirror image of one another. They could easily be seen as anthems of the right and the left - Everlast for the left, and Anthony for the right. They both hit on major culture war talking points.

Re-listening to *What It's Like* ten years ago made me feel very uncomfortable, but I didn’t know quite what to say at the time to the young man. Hindsight is 20/20, of course, but I wish I had said something like, “That’s a cool song. I liked it too. But be very careful about taking the moral high ground and giving in to self-pity. We have an amazing ability to rationalize our own sin. We can very easily feel like our pain is more than enough justification for just about any sin. But God calls us to faith and righteousness and love, regardless of our particular circumstances."

Is there a difference between the two songs? Is one of them true and one of them a lie?

There are many problems with the Everlast song, not least of which is the man's entirely self-serving justification of abortion. After all, he boasts about how he "stroked the fattest [dimes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dime)/ At least a couple of times/ Before I broke their heart" just a few lines later. But I'd like to focus on the common problem between them: bitterness, envy and self-pity. Christian men must flee from such things.

Anthony performed a [free concert](https://youtube.com/shorts/s3980umKuvY?feature=share) in front of a large crowd this past Sunday, and he took the opportunity to read the following passage from Psalm 37:

> The wicked plots against the righteous  
> And gnashes at him with his teeth.  
> The Lord laughs at him,  
> For He sees his day is coming.  
> The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow  
> To cast down the afflicted and the needy,  
> To slay those who are upright in conduct.  
> Their sword will enter their own heart,  
> And their bows will be broken.  
> Better is the little of the righteous  
> Than the abundance of many wicked.  
> For the arms of the wicked will be broken,  
> But the LORD sustains the righteous.  
> The LORD knows the days of the blameless,  
> And their inheritance will be forever.  
> They will not be ashamed in the time of evil,  
> And in the days of famine they will have abundance.  
> But the wicked will perish;  
> And the enemies of the LORD will be like the glory of the pastures,  
> They vanish--like smoke they vanish away.  

That's verses 12-20. Here are verses 1-6:

> Do not fret because of evildoers,  
> Be not envious toward wrongdoers.  
> For they will wither quickly like the grass  
> And fade like the green herb.  
> Trust in the LORD and do good;  
> Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.  
> Delight yourself in the LORD;  
> And He will give you the desires of your heart.  
> Commit your way to the LORD,  
> Trust also in Him, and He will do it.  
> He will bring forth your righteousness as the light  
> And your judgment as the noonday.  

And here are verses 23-26:

> The steps of a man are established by the LORD,  
> And He delights in his way.  
> When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong,  
> Because the LORD is the One who holds his hand.  
> I have been young and now I am old,  
> Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken  
> Or his descendants begging bread.  
> All day long he is gracious and lends,  
> And his descendants are a blessing.  

I moved to Bloomington in 2002 after deciding to drop out of college for a time. My life was upside down, and I clung to a line from this Psalm as a young man: "I have been young and now I am old, Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken Or his descendants begging bread.” Looking back, I can see that it could have been a perfect opportunity for me to give in to bitterness. But God had used my awful sin to teach me that I had nothing to be bitter about.

The central risk for both songs is the singer’s view of himself. If Anthony learns that he is his own worst enemy, and not the rich men north of Richmond, then he will be a wise man. But if he’s content to stroke my ego and ride his popularity to the top, he may write the anthem for a civil war, but not for a return to faith and righteousness.

When we give in to self-pity and bitterness, we demonstrate to the world that we have a very high view of ourselves. The Psalmist was able to declare that the Lord laughs at the wicked and to command us to "Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret; it leads only to evildoing."

Let's be that kind of man.
